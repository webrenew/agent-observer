# Docs Style Guide

Use this guide to keep docs consistent, actionable, and production-ready.

## Audience

Primary audience:

- developers operating Agent Observer in real projects
- technical users wiring external runners and automations

Write for execution, not marketing.

## Required Page Structure

Every guide page should include:

1. **When to use**
2. **Prerequisites**
3. **Step-by-step setup**
4. **Expected results**
5. **Failure modes and fixes**
6. **Related links**

If a page cannot satisfy these sections, it is likely too shallow.

## Writing Rules

- Prefer concrete steps over abstract statements.
- Include copy-paste commands where relevant.
- Name exact UI paths (example: `Settings -> Todo Runner`).
- Use explicit field names and contracts.
- Keep examples realistic and bounded.

Avoid:

- vague promises
- untestable claims
- feature lists with no operator guidance

## Example Quality Bar

Good:

- "Click **Run now** and verify `lastRunAt` updates."

Weak:

- "Make sure the task works."

## Maintenance Rules

Update docs in the same PR when you change:

- IPC contracts
- persisted file formats
- user-facing labels/paths
- runtime behavior or retry semantics

## QA Checklist Before Merge

1. New/changed pages linked from nav.
2. No dead internal links.
3. Steps are executable from a clean install.
4. Runtime contracts match source code.
5. Troubleshooting paths cover likely operator failures.

## Suggested Ownership

- Each feature area has a named docs owner.
- Release checklist includes docs verification.
- Stale pages are reviewed on a regular cadence.
