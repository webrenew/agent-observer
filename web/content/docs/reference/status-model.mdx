# Status Model

Agent Space keeps status language consistent across chat, office, and timeline views.

## Agent States

- `idle`: no active work
- `thinking`: model planning/analysis in progress
- `tool_calling`: executing tool actions
- `streaming`: actively generating output
- `waiting`: blocked on external input/state
- `done`: task completed successfully
- `error`: task failed or stopped with issue

## Activity Labels

- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Tool`, and similar labels reflect actual actions.
- `CRON` is reserved for scheduled repeated tasks only.

## Consistency Rules

- Labels should match underlying event type.
- Token and activity updates should stay in sync.
- Office active-agent count should reflect active chat sessions.
