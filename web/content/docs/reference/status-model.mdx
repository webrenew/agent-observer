# Status Model

This page defines the language used for runtime status and activity labels.

## Agent States

- `idle`: no active work
- `thinking`: model planning/analysis
- `tool_calling`: tool actions running
- `streaming`: output actively streaming
- `waiting`: blocked on external state/input
- `done`: completed successfully
- `error`: completed with failure

## Scheduler Status

For scheduled tasks:

- `idle`: no run yet or paused
- `running`: active execution
- `success`: last run succeeded
- `error`: last run failed

Trigger types:

- `cron`
- `manual`

## Todo Runner Status

For todo-runner jobs:

- `idle`: job defined but not running
- `running`: currently processing an item
- `success`: latest item run succeeded
- `error`: latest item run failed

Trigger types:

- `auto` (queue progression)
- `manual` (explicit user action)

Progress fields to watch:

- `completedTodos`
- `failedTodos`
- `blockedTodos`
- `currentTodoIndex`

## Activity Label Rules

- Labels should reflect real underlying actions.
- `CRON` is only for scheduled repeated actions.
- Todo Runner progress is represented through job/todo status, not CRON labels.

## Consistency Requirements

- UI status should update from runtime state transitions.
- Error surfaces must include actionable text.
- Panel-level status and automation card status should not diverge.
