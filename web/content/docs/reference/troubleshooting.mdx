# Troubleshooting

## App opens in temp directory

Symptom: workspace resolves to a temp path like `/var/folders/.../agent-space-smoke-*`.

Fix:

1. Set default app workspace to your intended directory (for example `/Users/tradecraft/dev`).
2. Reopen workspace from Explorer and verify path in scope indicator.

## Blue screen / renderer crash

1. Restart app.
2. Reopen one workspace first.
3. Check local logs for renderer/main process errors.
4. If reproducible, capture steps and last action before crash.

## Search missing expected files

1. Confirm workspace root is correct.
2. Verify excluded directories are not your target paths.
3. Grant missing file permissions in macOS privacy settings.

## Duplicate active agents

If one chat appears as multiple office agents, refresh session state or restart app and verify single active thread.
