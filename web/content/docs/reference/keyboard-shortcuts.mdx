# Keyboard Shortcuts

Shortcuts may vary slightly by OS and focused panel, but these are the core defaults.

## Chat

- `Enter`: send message
- `Shift + Enter`: newline
- `@`: open file reference suggestions
- `Cmd/Ctrl + V`: paste text or image into chat

## Navigation

- Use Explorer focus to change workspace folder context quickly
- Use Search panel for rapid file lookup before prompting
- Use Help menu to view in-app legend and symbol meanings

## Terminal

- Terminal keymaps follow shell defaults
- Status badges in terminal tabs indicate current mode/state
