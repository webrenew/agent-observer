# Keyboard Shortcuts

Shortcut behavior can vary slightly by OS and focus context, but these are core defaults.

## Chat Input

- `Enter`: send message
- `Shift + Enter`: newline
- `@`: open file mention suggestions
- `Cmd/Ctrl + V`: paste text or image

## Navigation Habits

Agent Observer currently relies heavily on panel-focused interactions.

High-value habits:

- keep Explorer focused when changing workspace context
- use Search before prompting for multi-file work
- verify active panel before typing shortcuts

## Terminal Notes

- terminal keybindings follow your shell/editor defaults
- terminal tabs show status badges for runtime visibility

## Operator Tips

1. Use keyboard-first file lookup before chat prompts.
2. Keep prompts short and iterative for faster validation loops.
3. Use one focused tab/workspace when running high-risk tasks.
