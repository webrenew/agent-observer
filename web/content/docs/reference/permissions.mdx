# Permissions

Agent Observer depends on local filesystem access to provide workspace-scoped workflows.

## Required Permission Categories

- file/folder access for workspace browsing and search
- optional notification permission for completion alerts

## Minimum Recommended Access

Grant access to:

- your active repository root(s)
- any directories used by schedules or todo-runner jobs

Avoid broad system-level access unless needed for your workflow.

## Verify Permission Health

1. Open workspace in Explorer.
2. Search for a known file.
3. Open file in editor panel.
4. Run one small chat action referencing that file.

If any step fails, check macOS privacy settings.

## macOS Settings Path

`System Settings -> Privacy & Security`

Check relevant categories and ensure Agent Observer is allowed for the intended directories.

## Repeated Prompt Or Access Errors

1. Reconfirm permissions in macOS settings.
2. Restart Agent Observer.
3. Reopen workspace and retry.
4. If still failing, reduce to one test directory and validate from there.

## Automation-Specific Reminder

Schedules and Todo Runner both rely on valid directory access for each configured job/task.

A missing permission can look like a runtime failure even when prompt/runner logic is correct.
