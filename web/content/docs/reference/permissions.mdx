# Permissions

Agent Space requests local filesystem and app-access permissions for project-aware workflows.

## Common macOS Prompts

- File and folder access for workspace search and indexing
- App data access for broader local context (if enabled)
- Notification permissions for completion dings/alerts

## Recommended Settings

- Grant project folder access at minimum.
- Avoid broad system directories unless needed.
- Review access in `System Settings > Privacy & Security`.

## If Prompt Repeats

1. Open privacy settings and confirm Agent Space has the required category enabled.
2. Restart Agent Space.
3. Reopen target workspace and re-run search/action.
