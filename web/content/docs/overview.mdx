# Overview

Agent Space is a local-first control plane for AI-assisted development work.

It combines chat, terminal, file context, and operational telemetry so users can run agent workflows with tighter scope and better observability.

## Who It Is For

- developers running AI workflows across local repositories
- operators managing recurring and long-running coding tasks
- teams that need clearer runtime visibility than plain terminal sessions

## Core Product Surfaces

- **Explorer**: choose and verify workspace scope
- **Search**: fast local file discovery
- **Chat**: workspace-scoped agent interactions
- **Terminal**: command execution visibility
- **Activity/Office/Tokens**: runtime observability and status
- **Settings**: scheduler and todo-runner automation controls

## Primary Jobs To Be Done

1. Run one-off coding tasks with exact workspace context.
2. Schedule recurring checks and maintenance prompts.
3. Execute large todo backlogs to completion with progress tracking.
4. Diagnose failures quickly from runtime state and error surfaces.

## Product Principles

- **Scope first**: every run should be anchored to a known directory.
- **Local first**: workflows should work with local files and local tooling.
- **Operational clarity**: state should be visible without guesswork.
- **Recoverability**: long tasks should resume safely after interruption.

## Choosing The Right Automation Mode

- Use **Schedules** for recurring, time-based prompts.
- Use **Todo Runner** for finite large checklists that must run until done.
