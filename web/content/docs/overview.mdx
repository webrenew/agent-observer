# Overview

Agent Space is designed for developers running AI agents locally who need a single control plane across chat, tools, files, and terminal work.

## Core Surfaces

- **Explorer**: project tree with quick path targeting
- **Search**: fast local file discovery
- **Chat**: workspace-scoped agent conversations
- **Terminal**: command execution and session visibility
- **Tokens/Office**: telemetry and real-time 3D activity

## Why It Exists

- Reduce context switching across coding tools.
- Keep each agent run anchored to the correct directory.
- Track operations and cost signals in one place.
