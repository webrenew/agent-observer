# Architecture

Agent Space combines an Electron desktop runtime with a Next.js web surface.

## High Level

- **Desktop**: Electron + renderer panels for chat, explorer, terminal, and office scene.
- **Web**: Next.js site mirroring visual language and product capabilities.
- **State**: workspace-first context and agent telemetry stores.

## Design Principles

- Keep project scope explicit and visible.
- Preserve local-first behavior.
- Make operational state legible at a glance.
- Keep desktop and web mental models aligned.
