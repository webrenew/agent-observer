# Monitoring

Agent Observer exposes runtime state so operators can detect failures quickly and keep long-running work healthy.

## What To Monitor

## Agent/session level

- status transitions (`thinking`, `tool_calling`, `streaming`, `done`, `error`)
- active agent count vs expected active chats
- token movement relative to workload intensity

## Scheduler level

- task status distribution (success/error)
- `nextRunAt` correctness
- recurring failure patterns by task

## Todo Runner level

- completed vs total todos
- failed and blocked counts
- current item and retry pressure

## Daily Operator Checks

1. Review any `error` statuses first.
2. Check for blocked todo items.
3. Validate recurring tasks still match current repository structure.
4. Confirm token/activity behavior is plausible.

## Alert-Like Heuristics

Investigate quickly if:

- many schedule failures appear after a repo change
- todo jobs stall repeatedly on one item
- token counters flatline during expected model activity
- activity labels do not match runtime behavior

## Label Semantics

- `CRON` should represent scheduled repeated work only.
- Todo Runner work should be interpreted through job progress state, not CRON semantics.

## Incident Notes Best Practice

For recurring failures, record:

- failing task/job id
- exact error message
- first observed timestamp
- root cause
- mitigation applied

This makes future regression diagnosis much faster.
