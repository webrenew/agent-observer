# Monitoring

Agent Space provides live telemetry during chat and tool execution.

## What You Can Monitor

- Agent status transitions (`thinking`, `tool_calling`, `done`, `error`)
- Timeline actions and recency
- Token input/output totals
- File modifications and active task context

## Operational Notes

- Activity labels should match action types (for example, `CRON` is only for scheduled runs).
- A single chat should correspond to one active office agent unless multi-agent mode is intentionally enabled.
- Token counters should move with chat/tool events and remain zero only when no model calls were made.
