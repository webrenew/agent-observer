# Memory and Scope

Agent Space keeps chat context grounded to the selected workspace.

## Scope Model

- **Workspace mode**: default scope follows opened project directory.
- **Custom directory mode**: user can explicitly set chat scope for multi-project usage.
- **Pre-message scoping**: scope is resolved before first user message when opening folders.

## Best Practices

- Keep one chat per project scope when possible.
- Use explicit scope switching for cross-repo work.
- Validate scope indicator before prompting long-running tasks.
