# Integrations

Agent Space is built to coexist with local-first coding workflows.

## Supported Workflows

- Claude Code sessions and command execution
- Local file search and read/write operations
- Explorer-based project targeting
- Scheduled actions (CRON) in-app

## Integration Direction

- Keep terminal and chat state synchronized.
- Route app actions through explicit workspace context.
- Prefer system-level notifications for chat completion events.
