description: How Agent Observer integrates with local tools, agent runtimes, and external runner commands.

# Integrations

Agent Observer is designed to integrate with local-first development tooling rather than replacing it.

## Integration Categories

## 1) Local Project + Filesystem

Used for:

- workspace scoping
- explorer/search/file context
- prompt grounding to local files

Operational requirement:

- grant file permissions to target workspace paths in macOS.

## 2) Agent Runtime Sessions

Agent Observer can orchestrate agent runtime behavior through its desktop runtime layer.

Examples:

- Claude-oriented session flows in app runtime
- local CLI command execution in terminal context

## 3) Scheduler Automation

Recurring prompts through **Settings -> Schedules**.

Best for:

- periodic checks
- recurring reporting
- predictable maintenance loops

## 4) Todo Runner Automation

External runner command execution through **Settings -> Todo Runner**.

Best for:

- large finite checklists
- Agent SDK-backed custom workers
- resumable multi-item workloads

## Integration Patterns That Scale

1. Keep one workspace per active workflow.
2. Keep prompts deterministic and output-focused.
3. Validate small before scaling up batch size/frequency.
4. Treat runner contracts as API boundaries (version and test them).

## Recommended Stack For Long-Running Work

- Agent Observer Todo Runner for orchestration/progress state
- custom Anthropic Agent SDK worker for execution logic
- repository-level CI for post-run verification

## Integration Anti-Patterns

- unscoped prompts across many repositories
- runner commands with hidden side effects outside workspace
- silent failure behavior (exit `0` on actual failure)
- recurring jobs without first-run validation
