# Scheduled Actions

Agent Space supports scheduled actions for repeated tasks.

## What CRON Means in Agent Space

- `CRON` indicates a scheduled repeated task.
- `CRON` is not a file glob and should not label non-scheduled actions.

## Typical Use Cases

- Daily repo health checks
- Repeated summary generation
- Scheduled maintenance prompts
- Routine reporting workflows

## Setup Guidance

1. Define the task prompt clearly.
2. Pick a schedule and expected runtime window.
3. Set workspace directory scope for the task.
4. Validate results in activity timeline and output panels.

## Validation

- Timeline entries should show `CRON` only for scheduled runs.
- Task output should include timestamps and workspace context.
- Failures should be visible in activity and logs.
