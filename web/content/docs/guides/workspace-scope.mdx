title: Workspace Scope
description: Keep each chat and agent run scoped to the correct project directory.

# Workspace Scope

Agent Space is workspace-first. Every chat should run against a known directory before the first message is sent.

## Default Behavior

- Opening a folder in Explorer sets workspace scope.
- New chat sessions inherit that selected workspace.
- Scope is resolved before mount so the first prompt starts with correct context.

## Custom Directory Mode

Use custom directory mode when you need one workspace open but want a chat scoped to another folder.

Recommended pattern:

1. Select the primary workspace in Explorer.
2. In chat, switch directory scope for the active tab.
3. Confirm scope indicator before starting long tasks.

## Good Habits

- One project per chat tab when possible.
- Use explicit scope switches for multi-repo tasks.
- Avoid cross-project prompts without verifying scope.
