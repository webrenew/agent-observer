# Workspace Scope

Workspace scope is the highest-impact control in Agent Observer.

Most bad outcomes in AI coding workflows start with wrong scope.

## Scope Model

- **Explorer-selected workspace** is the default scope.
- New chat runs inherit that scope.
- Scope should be verified before long or destructive tasks.

## Standard Operating Procedure

Before every important run:

1. Confirm current workspace path in UI.
2. Confirm target files are inside that path.
3. Mention critical files explicitly in prompt.
4. Start with a narrow first action.

## Multi-Repo Workflow Pattern

When you must work across repositories:

1. Use separate chat tabs per repository.
2. Switch scope explicitly before each run.
3. Keep prompts repository-specific.
4. Avoid mixed-repo prompts without explicit path constraints.

## Pre-Flight For Long Runs

Before schedules or todo batches:

1. Open a representative file in target repo.
2. Run one small validation prompt.
3. Confirm output references expected project context.
4. Only then start recurring or batch automation.

## Common Scope Failure Cases

### Case: Editing wrong repository

Fix:

- pause current automation
- switch workspace correctly
- rerun with explicit path boundaries

### Case: Search results look incomplete

Fix:

- verify workspace root
- verify file permissions
- ensure target path is inside workspace

## Scope Safety Rules

- One project per tab by default.
- One automation job per repository path when possible.
- Prefer explicit paths over implied context.
