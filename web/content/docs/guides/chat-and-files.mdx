# Chat and Files

Agent Space chat supports file-aware workflows for local coding tasks.

## Add Files to Context

- Use `@` mentions to reference files in prompts.
- Pick files from Explorer when building multi-file requests.
- Keep references explicit for reproducible agent runs.

## Images in Chat

- Paste screenshots directly into chat input.
- Upload images manually as a fallback.
- Use images for UI bugs, render issues, or visual diffs.

## Explorer + Search Workflow

1. Open project folder in Explorer.
2. Use Search to find target files quickly.
3. Reference files in chat with `@` or direct path.
4. Run actions, then verify changes in editor/diff view.

## Search Notes

- Local search is optimized for project roots.
- Excluded system/app container paths reduce noisy results.
- Granting additional file permissions can improve index coverage.
